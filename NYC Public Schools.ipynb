    "#### 1. Problem Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset named Star is obtained from the website http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html. The dataset is a collection of 5748 observations of individual performance in math and reading tests accross 79 different schools. The variables are class sizes, years of teaching experience, gender, qualified for free lunch and race. Below are 5 example instances of the original dataset:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the scope of this project work, we focus on choosing only one variable and regress math scores based on that variable. The variable chosen here is years of teaching experience. Comparing the original distribution of math scores vs. log-scale of math scores, log-scale math scores seems to follow normal distribution better. Therefore, we choose to build our models with log-scale math scores. \n",
